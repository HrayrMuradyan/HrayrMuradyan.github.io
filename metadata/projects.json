    "description": "The aim of the project is to use Git and GitHub for collaborative data analysis, ensuring smooth teamwork and version control. It focuses on managing software and environment dependencies using virtual environments and containers, while automating data science workflows and creating non-interactive scripts and analysis pipelines for efficient and reproducible work. Additionally, the project involves running literate coding documents non-interactively for streamlined documentation and analysis.",
