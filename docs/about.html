              <h2>Undergraduate</h2>
              <p>In 2020, I got accepted to the American University of Armenia where I spent four years pursuing my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Data Science</strong> degree. 
                The university is considered the best in Armenia providing the highest quality of education with North American standards. 
                I was not only equipped with technical knowledge but also developed important soft skills that have shaped who I am today. 
                <br><br><strong>One interesting fact</strong> about me is that I always face new challenges with full energy and solid preparation, ready to take on anything. 
                But once I realize things aren’t as tough as I expected, I tend to relax a bit too much. That’s what happened to me in my undergrad. 
                Eventually, I saw a slight decrease in productivity and performance in the middle of the program. 
                But when it comes to group assignments, I naturally take charge, feeling responsible for everyone and pushing the team forward rather than holding it back. 
                Thanks to that, I’ve never got less than a perfect grade on any group project. 
                Regarding my overall performance, at some point, I immediately regroup, refocus, and end up doing even better than before. 
                It’s a bit of a parabola-like performance, but at the end I always end up right at the top.</p>

          <h2>First Job Experience</h2>
          <p class="center-paragraph">
            I always thought of summer breaks as great time to study independently, advance skills, learn something new.
            It took two summer holidays to read the following two wonderful books and complete Deep Learning Specialization course by DeepLearning.AI.

            Thanks to those efforts, I got my first Machine Learning Internship opportunity at <b>CareAware</b>.
          </p>
          <h3>My role as an intern</h3>
          <p class="work-experience-paragraph">
            CareAware is a startup that builds its own products while also partnering with other companies on contract-based projects. 
            Initially, we worked on a demonstrative vision-based "fall detection" project, which was part of the product, as a team of three interns. 
            Although we were all interns, I was assigned as the lead of the team, guiding it and regularly communicating our progress to the company's more experienced members.
          </p>
          <h3>My role as a full-time engineer</h3>
          <p class="work-experience-paragraph">
            After being an intern for about three months, I was offered a full-time position and began contributing to various projects.
            Some partner projects were easier, while others were complex and had tight deadlines. 
            Team members who could contribute valuable knowledge and expertise were often reassigned to other projects to help enhance overall performance.
            I was one of those team members. The dynamic environment gave me an opportunity to learn from different people, gain insight into their working styles and share with my experience with them as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of 9 months, I contributed to <b>6 different projects across 5 teams</b>, working on a range of tasks in computer vision and time-series classification.
          </p>
          <p>Overall, my first job at CareAware was a valuable experience where I gained lots of practical knowledge and grew quickly as a professional. 
            I also made good friends, built strong connections with the whole team and I believe we truly enjoyed working together.
            Even after leaving the company, I am still in touch with my former team members and the CEO.

          <p class="center-paragraph">
            During the Spring 2023 semester, I took a Machine Learning course. At the end of the term, while submitting a paper-based quiz, professor asked about my availability outside of the class for a potential opportunity to join an industry project.
