              <h2>Undergraduate</h2>
              <p>In 2020, I got accepted to the American University of Armenia where I spent four years pursuing my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Data Science</strong> degree. 
                The university is considered the best in Armenia providing the highest quality of education with North American standards. 
                I was not only equipped with technical knowledge but also developed important soft skills that have shaped who I am today. 
                <br><br><strong>One interesting fact</strong> about me is that I always face new challenges with full energy and solid preparation, ready to take on anything. 
                But once I realize things aren’t as tough as I expected, I tend to relax a bit too much. That’s what happened to me in my undergrad. 
                Eventually, I saw a slight decrease in productivity and performance in the middle of the program. 
                But when it comes to group assignments, I naturally take charge, feeling responsible for everyone and pushing the team forward rather than holding it back. 
                Thanks to that, I’ve never got less than a perfect grade on any group project. 
                Regarding my overall performance, at some point, I immediately regroup, refocus, and end up doing even better than before. 
                It’s a bit of a parabola-like performance, but at the end I always end up right at the top.</p>

          <h2>First Job Experience</h2>
          <p>
            I always thought of the summer break as a great time to study independently, advance skills, learn something new.
            I was at my early university years so I was not thinking very critically and was not in a hurry.
            It took two summer holidays to read the following two wonderful books and complete Deep Learning Specialization course by DeepLearning.AI.

            Thanks to those efforts, I got my first internship opportunity at <b>CareAware</b>.
